        "description": "Gene AUSTIN & Frank Banta at the piano - Tamiami Trail (Cliff Friend /Joseph H. Santly), Victor 1926\n\nNOTE: Gene AUSTIN (né Lemuel Eugene Lucas) American crooner, born in 1900 in Gainsville in region of Red River Valley -- a typical \"cattle country\" of North Texas. He took his name from his stepfather, Jim Austin who was a blacksmith. Gene was a self-taught pianist and singer, who took his first singing lessons from the wandering cowboys and who learned how to play piano from tappers, accompanying the girls'shows at the local saloon. He run away from home at age of 15 and started presenting his singing talents at the amateur vadeuville stage in Houston. In  age of 17, he joined the army and was dispatched to France. In 1919, on his return to the US, Austin started studying dentistry in Baltimore, MD also spending a lot of time on singing in local taverns and writing songs, without any significant success. His life rapidly changed, when he met Lou Clayton - member of the popular „Three Sawdust Bums\" (Clayton, Jackson, and Jimmy Durante). This opened Austin way to his first recording for Victor, which was his song \"When My Sugar Walks Down the Street\". The song became a great hit and in later years, it was recorded by greatest artists of radio and stage, including Bix Beiderbecke, Duke Ellington, Red Nichols, Ella Fitzgerald, or The Ink Spots. On next decade, Nick Austin managed to develop his unique style of singing: along with Rudy Vallee, Nick Lucas, Johnny Marvin and Cliff Edwards, he adopted an intimate, radio-friendly, close-miked style that took over from the more sentimental vocals popularized by Henry Burr and Billy Murray. Such later crooners as Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, and Russ Columbo all credited Austin with creating the musical genre that began their careers. Solely in the decade of 1920-30, Gene Austin sold over 80 million records—a total unmatched by a single artist for 40 years. His 1926 \"Bye Bye Blackbird\" was in the year's top twenty records. George A. Whiting and Walter Donaldson's \"My Blue Heaven\" sold over five million copies (until Bing Crosby's \"White Christmas\" replaced it, it was the largest selling record of all time). Offered to work in Hollywood at the height of his career as the \"Voice of the Southland\", Austin appeared in three films, Belle of the Nineties (1934), Klondike Annie (1936) and My Little Chickadee (1940), at the request of his personal friend, Mae West. In 1956, CBS made a television drama about Austin's life. In 1962, Austin campaigned unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination for governor of Nevada. Austin had retired to Palm Springs, in the late 1950s, living comfortably the rest of his life on the income from his record sales. He died in 1972 in Palm Springs of lung cancer. \nFrank BANTA (1897--1969) American pianist, son of the pioneer recording pianist Frank P. Banta. In 1910s he was a piano accompanist for the Victor Talking Machine Company. In 1920s, Frank Banta participated in various dance ensambles, including  Joseph C. Smith's Orchestra and the Great White Way Orchestra. He also recorded as accompanist for Rudy Wiedoeft, Frank Crumit, Henry Burr or Gene Austin. He also recorded a few sides with his piano solos.",

Tchaikovsky dedicated the work to the St. Petersburg Chamber Music Society in response to his becoming an Honorary Member. The work, in the traditional four-movement form, was titled \"Souvenir de Florence\" because the composer sketched one of the work's principal themes while visiting Florence, Italy, where he composed The Queen of Spades. The work was revised between December 1891 and January 1892, before being premiered in 1892.\n\n1. Allegro con spirito (00:00)\n2. Adagio cantabile e con moto (10:16)\n3.

        "description": "Johann Nepomuk Hummel (14 November 1778 – 17 October 1837) was an Austrian composer and virtuoso pianist. His music reflects the transition from the Classical to the Romantic musical era.\n\nPlease support my channel:\nhttps://ko-fi.com/bartjebartmans\n\nPiano Concerto No.2 in A minor, Op. 85 (1816)\n\n1. Allegro moderato (0:00)\n2. Larghetto (15:28)\n3. Rondo - Allegro moderato (19:52)\n\nStephen Hough and the English Chamber Orchestra conducted by Bryden Thomson\n\nDescription by Robert Cummings  [-]\nEven into the twenty first century, Hummel's music is being assessed and reassessed, always with the view that his genius has been consistently underrated. His piano concertos are among his greatest accomplishments, and he might have excelled in the symphony too, had he not taken to heart so seriously his rivalry with Beethoven. Hummel's Second and Third piano concertos are undoubtedly his most popular, though even they have enjoyed paltry few recordings and relatively meager representation in the concert halls.\n\nThe A minor Second is cast in three movements: a lengthy Allegro moderato is followed by a very brief Larghetto and a substantial Rondo (Allegro moderato). The first movement opens with a long orchestral introduction wherein the striking main theme is immediately presented by the strings, a theme whose character is both restless and heroic, looking back toward the darker side of Mozart as well as to the contemporary grandiosity of Beethoven. An alternate melody follows, a jovial, proud creation introduced by the flute. When the piano enters, it gives a lighter treatment to the thematic material that is lighter in touch, but not in emotional expressivity. Hummel's development is full of deft elaborations and brilliant piano writing. His orchestration will recall Beethoven's throughout this movement, but his music has an individuality and great beauty, even if his contrapuntal skills fall a bit short of his great rival's.\n\nThe short second movement Larghetto serves as a kind of pleasant interlude between the two larger outer panels. The theme here is delicate and graceful in its Classical sweetness, its music having an almost mesmerizing serenity making one wish it would linger beyond its lovely five minutes. The Rondo finale follows without pause, the piano introducing a somewhat exotic rhythmic theme that gradually picks up momentum and richer textures. The music is striking here, the melody instantly sticking in the mind, so much so as to make the alternate material initially sound less interesting by contrast. The more subdued music that alternates with this theme is revealed upon second and third hearing, however, to be just as finely imagined as the opening theme. In the end, this concerto must be assessed as standing on about the same plateau as Beethoven's first two piano concertos.",
